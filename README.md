Android APK Expansion Demo

Introduction:
Google Play requires that the compressed APK that users download be no more than 100MB. If application has lots of high-fidelity graphics, media files, or other large assets, 100MB may not be enough. Thus, Google Play allows you to attach two large expansion files that supplement your APK.
